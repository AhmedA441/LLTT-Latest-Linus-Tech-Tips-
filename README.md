LLTT (LATEST LINUS TECH TIPS) is a random program I created on a whim because it seemed fun.

What it does -

1 - Opens the Latest Linus Tech tips video...
2 - sits on your desktop looking pretty. (the Logo is AI Generated so its not really pretty, it's not meant to be pretty anyway)

Instructions

API Limitations so can't call it without applying for a higher quota (the exe file), or just get your own API Key and compile the code for just yourself.
To get the API key go to  "https://console.cloud.google.com/" specifically get "YouTube Data API v3".

if you run it in python you will need to run "pip install requests" in CMD

If you want to change what channel the app points to (why would you do that) then change channel_id = "UCXuqSBlHAE6Xw-yeJA0Tunw" to your desired channel, if you dont know the channel id use this website "https://www.streamweasels.com/tools/youtube-channel-id-and-user-id-convertor/"

 Thats it, thats the documentation, feel free to ask anything.
